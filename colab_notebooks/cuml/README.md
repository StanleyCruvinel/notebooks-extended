| umap_supervised_demo | demostrate basic usage, plotting, and timing comparisons between supervised and unsupervised implementations of the CUDA (GPU) version of UMAP - **Visualization**|

#### Using Colab Notebooks
For easiest use of `colab_notebooks`, use `open in colab` (Google Chrome extension) to automatically open any RAPIDS Jupyter notebook in Google Colaboratory.
- The extension can be found in the Chrome store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-colab/iogfkhleblhcpcekbiedikdehleodpjo) or on GitHub [here](https://github.com/googlecolab/open_in_colab)
